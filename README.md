SET UP PROCESS

As required from the assignment, i completed set-up process for all of these.

1. OPERATING SYSTEM (OS): I make use of Macbook and the OS was preinstalled before now, so there wasn't any need for that. But i watched some tutorial videos on youtube and i'm confident i can install it if need be.

2. INTEGRATED DEVELOPEMENT ENVIROMENT (IDE): Installing an IDE didn't give any issues. I only searched for my preferred IDE (Visual Studio Codes) on Google and clicked on the first link https://code.visualstudio.com/Download . I choosed the version compartible with my PC (MacOS) and downloaded it. After that, i installed it and searched for a few extensions such as Prettier and installed on it.

3. VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM (GITHUB): I already had a git hub account so there wasn'nt any need to create a new one. I only created a new repository from my terminal with the knowledge acquired from class and the help of ChatGPT in a few areas where i wasn't clear about what to do next. And some times when i made mistakes, i got hints from pre-installed GitHub. After that, i created a new repository on github with same name (assignment-project) as that on my terminal. I copied it and pasted on my terminal, and pushed to github for testing sake to see if i really know what i'm doing. I refreshed my github page and found it there. Since i wasn't done with the assignment, i cloned the repository on my code editor and started writing on here.

4. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Installing Python was easy from  http://wwww.python.org . First i was directed to install Python Installer for MacOS as it is important for downloading, installing, and running Python on MacOS, after which i was able to download and install Python.

5. DATABASE (MySQL): I only had network issues while indtalling MySQL. I searched on google for MySQL for MacOS and was directed to the community link. I was directed to download Homebrew as it's essential to download and configure MySQL. Afterwards i configured my data base using lessons from the class and the help of ChatGPT. I set my password and afterwards confirmed it has been installed.

6.  EXTENSIONS/PLUGINS (PRETTIER): After inctalling VSC on my PC, i also went ahead and installed a few vital extensions/plugins such as Prettier for code formating, Docker, live Share, SQTools ... etc. As they are vital for formatting codes thus making debugging easier and writes a cleaner code.
